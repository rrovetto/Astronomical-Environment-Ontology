# Astronomical Environment Ontology (AEO)

This ontology describes the astronomical environment (outer space environment) in general terms.

It aims for a global, neutral, and accurate model of the space environment. 

The vision is for an ontology that accounts for the fact that humanity may become spare-faring from other planets.
